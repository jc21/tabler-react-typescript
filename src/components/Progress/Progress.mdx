# Progress Bars

Progress bars are used to provide feedback on an action status and inform users
of the current progress. Although seemingly small interface elements, they are
extremely hepful in managing users' expectations and preventing them from
abandoning a process they have initiated.

## Usage

<Playground>
	<Progress value={50} />
</Playground>

## Sizes

Using Bootstrap’s typical naming structure, you can create a standard progress
bar or scale it up or down to different sizes based on what’s needed.

<Playground>
	<Progress value={33} size="sm" />
</Playground>

## Indeterminate

You can create a progress bar which shows indeterminate progress by adding
`indeterminate` to the component.

<Playground>
	<Progress value={0} size="sm" indeterminate />
</Playground>

## Colors

Customize the color of the progress bar to suit your design.

<Playground>
	<Progress value={20} size="sm" className="mb-2" color="red" />
	<Progress value={40} size="sm" className="mb-2" color="green" />
	<Progress value={60} size="sm" className="mb-2" color="purple" />
	<Progress value={80} size="sm" className="mb-2" color="pink" />
	<Progress value={99} size="sm" className="mb-2" color="warning" />
</Playground>

## Properties

<Props of={Progress} />
