# Empty

Empty states or blank pages are commonly used as placeholders for first-use,
empty data or error screens. Their aim is to engage users when there is no
content to display and that is why their design is extremely important from the
point of view of the user experience of your website or app.

## Usage

Instead of adding an icon or illustration you can simply give the header text:

<Playground>
	<Empty
		headerText="404"
		title="No results found"
		subTitle="Try adjusting your search or filter to find what you're looking for."
		button={
			<Button color="primary">
				<ArrowLeft /> Take me home
			</Button>
		}
	/>
</Playground>

## Icon

Engage users in the critical moments of their experience with your website or
app. A good empty state screen should let users know what is happening and what
they should do next as well as encourage them to take action.

<Playground>
	<Empty
		icon={<MoodSad />}
		title="No results found"
		subTitle="Try adjusting your search or filter to find what you're looking for."
		button={
			<Button color="primary">
				<Search /> Search again
			</Button>
		}
	/>
</Playground>

## Image

Make your empty state screen more attractive and engaging by adding an
illustration. Thanks to a more personalized design, you will improve your brand
image and make your website or app more user friendly.

<Playground>
	<Empty
		image="https://tabler-react-typescript.jc21.com/assets/undraw_quitting_time_dm8t.svg"
		title="Invoices are managed from here"
		subTitle="Try adjusting your search or filter to find what you're looking for."
		button={
			<Button color="primary">
				<Plus /> New invoice
			</Button>
		}
	/>
</Playground>
