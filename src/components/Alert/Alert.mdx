# Alert

Alert messages are used to inform users of the status of their action and help
them solve any problems that might have occurred. Good design of alert modals is
very important for the overall user experience of a website or app.

## Usage

Depending on the information you need to convey, you can use one of the
following types of alert messages - success, info, warning or danger. Using the
right type of alert modal will help draw usersâ€™ attention to the message and
prompt them to take action.

<Playground>
	<Alert type="success" title="Wow! Everything worked!">
		Your account has been saved!
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="info" title="Did you know?">
		Here is something that you might like to know.
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="warning" title="Uh oh, something went wrong">
		Sorry! There was a problem with your request.
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="danger" title="I'm so sorry">
		Your account has been deleted and can't be restored.
	</Alert>
</Playground>

## Dismissable

Add the `x` close button to make an alert modal dismissible. Thanks to that,
your alert modal will disappear only once the user closes it.

<Playground>
	<Alert type="success" title="Wow! Everything worked!" dismissable>
		Your account has been saved!
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="info" title="Did you know?" dismissable>
		Here is something that you might like to know.
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="warning" title="Uh oh, something went wrong" dismissable>
		Sorry! There was a problem with your request.
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="danger" title="I'm so sorry" dismissable>
		Your account has been deleted and can't be restored.
	</Alert>
</Playground>

## Important

If you want your alert to be really eye-catching!

<Playground>
	<Alert
		type="success"
		icon={<Check size={32} color="white" />}
		important
		dismissable>
		Your account has been saved!
	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="info"
		icon={<InfoCircle size={32} color="white" />}
		important
		dismissable>

	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="warning"
		icon={<AlertTriangle size={32} color="white" />}
		important
		dismissable>
		Sorry! There was a problem with your request.
	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="danger"
		icon={<AlertCircle size={32} color="white" />}
		important
		dismissable>
		Your account has been deleted and can't be restored.
	</Alert>
</Playground>

## Icons

Add an icon to your alert modal to make it more user-friendly and help users
easily identify the message.

<Playground>
	<Alert
		type="success"
		title="Wow! Everything worked!"
		icon={<Check size={32} color="green" />}>
		Your account has been saved!
	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="info"
		title="Did you know?"
		icon={<InfoCircle size={32} color="blue" />}>
		Here is something that you might like to know.
	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="warning"
		title="Uh oh, something went wrong"
		icon={<AlertTriangle size={32} color="orange" />}>
		Sorry! There was a problem with your request.
	</Alert>
	<Alert
		type="danger"
		title="I'm so sorry"
		icon={<AlertCircle size={32} color="red" />}>
		Your account has been deleted and can't be restored.
	</Alert>
</Playground>

## Avatars

Add an avatar to your alert modal to make it more personalized.

<Playground>
	<Alert
		type="success"
		avatar={
			<span
				className="avatar"
				style={{
					backgroundImage:
						"url(https://tabler-react-typescript.jc21.com/assets/000m.jpg)",
				}}></span>
		}>
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Lorem ipsum
		dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
		amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
	</Alert>
	<Alert type="info" avatar={<span className="avatar">JL</span>}>

	</Alert>
	<Alert

				style={{

						"url(https://tabler-react-typescript.jc21.com/assets/003m.jpg)",
				}}></span>
		}>
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Lorem ipsum
		dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
		amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
	</Alert>
</Playground>

## Buttons

Add primary and secondary buttons to your alert modals if you want users to take
a particular action based on the information included in the modal message.

<Playground>
	<Alert type="success" title="Some Title">
		<p>
			Lorem ipsum Minim ad pariatur eiusmod ea ut nulla aliqua est quis id
			dolore minim voluptate.
		</p>
		<div className="btn-list">

			<a href="#" className="btn">
				Cancel
			</a>
		</div>
	</Alert>
