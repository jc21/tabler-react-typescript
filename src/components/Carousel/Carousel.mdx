# Carousel

A carousel is used to display multiple pieces of visual content without taking
up too much space. Carousels eliminate the need to scroll down the page to see
all content and are a popular method of displaying marketing information.

## Usage

Use a carousel to make your website design more visually appealing for users. In
the default carousel design, respective elements slide automatically and users
can go to the next slide by clicking an arrow.

<Playground>
	<div style={{ maxWidth: "30rem" }}>
		<Carousel />
	</div>
</Playground>

## Properties

<Props of={Carousel} />
