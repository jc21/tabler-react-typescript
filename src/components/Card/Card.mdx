# Card

Cards are flexible user interface elements, which help organize content into
meaningful sections and make it easier to display on different screen sizes.
Cards contain various smaller components, such as images, text, links and
buttons and may act as an entry to more detailed information, helping users scan
the page quickly and find the most relevant content.

## Usage

Create a card and use it as the basis for a more advanced card design. A card is
a perfect way to organize content and make it look neat and tidy.

<Playground>
	<Card title="Card Title" statusColor="info">
		Card Body
	</Card>
</Playground>

## Sizes

You can change the padding of a newly created card.

Small cards are well suited for small items such as widgets, etc., while the
Large cards can be used for large blocks of text. Padding will be automatically
reduced on small devices, to fit the screen size.

<Playground>
	<Card size="sm">Small</Card>
	<br />
	<Card size="md">Medium</Card>
	<br />
	<Card size="lg">Large</Card>
</Playground>

## Titles

Titles are a nice aesthetic to add separation of content.

<Playground>
	<Card title="Title 1">Body</Card>
</Playground>

## Status Color

Add a status color to your card, either at the top or on the side of the card,
to customise it and make it more eye-catching.

<Playground>
	<Card title="Title 1" statusColor="info">
		Body
	</Card>
	<br />
	<Card title="Title 2" statusColor="success" statusPosition="start">
		Body
	</Card>
</Playground>

## Stacked

Use the `stacked` property to stack up multiple cards, if you want to save
screen space or create a visually appealing effect.

<Playground>
	<Card stacked>Body</Card>
</Playground>
