# Button

Use button styles that best suit your designs and encourage users to take the
desired actions. You can customize the button's properties to improve the user
experience of your website or system, changing the size, shape, color and many
more.

## Usage

As one of the most common elements of UI design, buttons have a very important
function of engaging users with your website or app and guiding them in their
actions.

The standard button creates a white background and subtle hover animation. It’s
meant to look and behave as an interactive element of your page.

Use the button classes that correspond to the function of your button. The big
range of available colors will help you show your buttons’ purpose and make them
easy to spot.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button>Default</Button>
		<Button color="primary">Primary</Button>
		<Button color="secondary">Secondary</Button>
		<Button color="success">Success</Button>
		<Button color="warning">Warning</Button>
		<Button color="danger">Danger</Button>
		<Button color="info">Info</Button>
		<Button color="light">Light</Button>
		<Button color="dark">Dark</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Disabled

Make buttons look inactive to show that an action is possible once the user
meets certain criteria, such as completing the required fields to submit a form.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button disabled>Default</Button>
		<Button disabled color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button disabled color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Loading

Add the `loading` property to show a button’s loading state, which can be useful
in the case of operations that take longer to process. Thanks to that, users
will be aware of the current state of their action and won’t give it up before
it’s finished.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button loading color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button loading color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Ghost

Use the `ghost` shape to make your button look simple yet aesthetically
appealing. Ghost buttons help focus users’ attention on the website’s primary
design, at the same time encouraging them to take action.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button shape="ghost" color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Outline

Use the `outline` shape if you want to remove the color and the background of
your button and give it a more subtle look. Outline buttons are perfect to use
as secondary buttons, as they don’t distract users from the main action.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button shape="outline" color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button shape="outline" color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Square

Use the `square` shape to remove the border radius, if you want the corners of
your button to be square rather than rounded.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button shape="square" color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button shape="square" color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Pill

Add the `pill` shape to your button to make it rounded and give it a modern and
attractive look.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button shape="pill" color="primary">
			Primary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="secondary">
			Secondary
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="success">
			Success
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="warning">
			Warning
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="danger">
			Danger
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="info">
			Info
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="light">
			Light
		</Button>
		<Button shape="pill" color="dark">
			Dark
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Colors

Choose the right color for your button to make it go well with your design and
draw users’ attention. Button colors can have a big influence on users’
decisions, which is why it’s important to choose them based on the intended
purpose.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button color="blue">Blue</Button>
		<Button color="azure">Azure</Button>
		<Button color="indigo">Indigo</Button>
		<Button color="purple">Purple</Button>
		<Button color="pink">Pink</Button>
		<Button color="red">Red</Button>
		<Button color="orange">Orange</Button>
		<Button color="yellow">Yellow</Button>
		<Button color="lime">Lime</Button>
		<Button color="green">Green</Button>
		<Button color="teal">Teal</Button>
		<Button color="cyan">Cyan</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Sizes

Add `size` property to change the size of your button and differentiate those
which should have primary focus from those of secondary importance. Adapt the
button size to your design and encourage users to take actions.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button color="primary" size="sm">
			Small
		</Button>
		<Button color="primary">Normal</Button>
		<Button color="primary" size="lg">
			Large
		</Button>
	</ButtonList>
</Playground>

## Social

You can use the icons of popular social networking sites, which users are
familiar with. Thanks to buttons with social media icons users can share content
or follow a website with just one click, without leaving the website.

<Playground>
	<ButtonList>
		<Button color="facebook">Facebook</Button>
		<Button color="twitter">Twitter</Button>
